# Force_ACF_Langevin_RPMD
Calculate the force autocorrelation function for RPMD system with Langevin equation analysis

There are two codes in this folder: Force_ACF.cpp and absorption.cpp. First code calculates the force autocorrelation function that the RPMD centroid experiences from the noncentroid modes. Second code uses the force ACF from the first code and calculates a absorbance spectrum for the centroid. Note that describes the theoretical detail for both codes are included in the folder as well.
